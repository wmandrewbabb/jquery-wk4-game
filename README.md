# I may have spent a little too much time playing with things
# This is good enough to turn in now, I think
# I might come back to this and mess with it some more
#
# ideas for improvement:
#
# --add a gem shatter effect on select
# --randomize the appearance of the gems each round
# --clean up the title bar, make a rules modal on the first play through
# --add currency or a move limiter to provide an alternate loss condition
# 
# right now I think I might just want this tossed in the respository and uploaded though
